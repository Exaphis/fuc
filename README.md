# Fast Unix Commands

The FUC-ing project provides modern unix commands focused on performance.

## Commands

- [`rmz`](rmz)
- [`cpz`](cpz)

## Goals

1. Performance: being the fastest alternative on the planet is the primary goal.
2. Usability: where applicable, improve the UX of the existing commands.

## Non-goals

- Portability: FUCs are primarily targeted at modern Linux installations.
- Compatibility: [coreutils](https://github.com/coreutils/coreutils) or
  its [Rust re-implementation](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils) will have the broadest and most
  stable set of options.
